# Snap-L-Earn
Snap-L-Earn is built with the motive to help photographers manage and sell their photographs on our platform. After coming to a conclusion that amateur and intermediate photographers find it very difficult to make a name for them, we would like to give photographers an opportunity to showcase their talent and earn for their best works.

In addition to managing and selling their piece of art, the photographers would also be able to look at other galleries and learn more about the various intricacies involved for that ‘Picture Perfect’. It would also be a one-stop place for various camera and their specifications, just to help a photographer grow!
Giving learning utmost importance, we will also provide the photographers with details about the latest workshops and competitions around their cities.

We wish for the hobby photographer to fall in love with photography!

# Technology and Tools

The Snap-L-Earn is built using HTML 5, Javascript, CSS, AJAX for UI and UX, Java for middle tier and MySQL for database.

Since we would be using HTML 5, the following browsers would be able to run the application:
1.	Internet Explorer 10 and above
2.	Mozilla Firefox 30 and above
3.	Google Chrome 35 and above
4.	Safari 8.0 and above

We used Apache Tomcat to deploy and run our application.
